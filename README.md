# Collaborative Data Science with RStudio and Git

This is an introduction to using version control with RStudio via the built-in integration with Git. It is designed for participants with a novice understanding of R (akin to the R lesson in Data Carpentry) but with no understanding of version control or Git. It can be taught in half a day (approximately 4 hours).

## Prerequisites

The lesson assumes a novice level understanding of R and RStudio (such as that obtained from Data Carpentry), but no knowledge of version control or Git is expected.
Learners will be provided with set up instructions for installing R and RStudio ahead of the lesson, and for creating a GitHub account in advance. The remaining software installation and set up will take place within the lesson. 

## Topics

Lesson content is under construction, but currently, the lesson is expected to include:

1. Introduction: Some software installation and set up steps plus an explanation of what version control is and why it is useful for writing R code and essential to modern, collaborative data science.

2. Working with RMarkdown: An introduction to RMarkdown documents, the rationale for using them, and guidance on creating, editing, and styling them within RStudio.

3. Version Control with Git: A brief introduction to the most important concepts for working with Git within RStudio.

4. Collaborating on Projects with GitHub: A step-by-step guide showing a simple example of how to create, clone, and collaborate on a GitHub repository within RStudio.

5. Publishing Projects: Tips on sharing and publishing code repositories, including how University of Auckland staff and students can use the University's institutional instance of Figshare to publish their code.
