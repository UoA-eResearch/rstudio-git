## Collaborative Data Science with RStudio & Git

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce R users to the version control features integrated into RStudio in order to collaborate on shared research projects. Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. When paired with remote repositories, version control systems allow researchers to seamlessly collaborate on analyses and manuscripts.

This workshop is aimed at researchers who already have some familiarity with R, for example to the level taught in Data Carpentry. Experience with Git and GitHub is useful but not required.
